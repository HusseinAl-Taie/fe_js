# fe_js


Why are we doing this? 

How I expected the challenge to go. 

What went well? 

What didn't go as planned? 

- Improve knowledge retention of JS as it will waste a longer time to gain it back to develop the project.
- later recordings of the training were challenging to go through

Possible improvements for future
implement the functions seperatly
